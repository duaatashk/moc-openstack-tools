## Email settings
# Specify the values used to customize email messages constructed using the
# TemplateMessage class. 
#
# These settings are used to configure the email and its headers:
#     sender        address from which email is sent (and where replies will go)
#     template      template file to use for the message body
#     cc_list       email addresses that should go in the CC list
#     subject       subject line of the email
#
# Sender and template are required, the rest are optional.
#
# Any other settings should correspond to placeholders in the template.
# For example, our welcome-template.txt contains the placeholders 
# `<LOGIN_URL>`, and `<SUPPORT_EMAIL>`. These are replaced by the `login_url` 
#  and `support_email` values defined in [welcome_email] below.
#
# If a value is defined below, but the corresponding keyword does not exist 
# in the given template, it will be silently ignored.
